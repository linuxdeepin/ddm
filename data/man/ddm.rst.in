SYNOPSIS
========

ddm [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
===========

ddm is a display and login manager based on Qt technologies and using
Treeland as greeter.

If pam and systemd are available, the greeter will go through logind,
which will give it access to drm devices.

Distributions without pam and systemd will need to put the **ddm** user
into the **video** group, otherwise errors regarding GL and drm devices
might be experienced.

For X11 sessions, the cookie for X authorization is written into a
temporary file `/tmp/xauth_XXXXXX`, owned and only accessible by the
user.
